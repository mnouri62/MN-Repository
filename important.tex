\title{Very Impressive Scientific Paper}
\author{Mohamad Nouri}
\date{13 April 2015}

\begin{document}
\In this paper we will comunicate a very important scientific result.

\section{Introduction}

The finding we describe below has been sought after by competing groups
 for years. In this section we will cite their publications and clearly 
point out the ways in which our approach is superior.

\section{Theoretical background}

It is all in Griffiths.

\section{Experimental resluts}

Here we include several vector-based graphics plotting the data we
 took, using well-coordinated colors that reproduce well in black and 
white.

\section{Discussion}

Our hypothesis was correct. Some said it couldn't be done, but we
proved all of them wrong.

\section{Materials and Methods}

We used a very expensive Helium-3 cryostat and fabricated samples 
in-house using reactive ion etching. Chirped pulse pairs we re
generated using a homebuilt pulse shaper using a spatial light
 modulator (SLM).

\section{Conlusion} 

We expect a call from Salem at any moment.
